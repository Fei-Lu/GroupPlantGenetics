/**
 * To model migration that is limited to a very short period of time, we can define one or more pulses.
 * A pulse has a proportions list property and a sources list property (analogous to the proportions and ancestors
 * properties of a deme). Each pulse proportion defines the proportion of the dest deme that is made up of ancestry
 * from the corresponding source deme at the instant after the pulseâ€™s time.
 *
 * The exact duration of a pulse is not defined by the Demes specification.
 * Software which implements a continuous-time model (such as a coalescent simulator) might treat a pulse as
 * occurring instantaneously. In contrast, software which implements a discrete-time model is free to treat the
 * pulse as occurring over a single time step (such as a single generation).
